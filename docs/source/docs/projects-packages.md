# Projects & Packages

## Projects

The first time you log in, you will be prompted to create a new project:

```

Creating additional projects and switching between projects is done with:

Menu: `Luminide > New Project`

Menu: `Luminide > Open Project`

A project tracks code changes as well as the output of each experiment run.  New projects are empty, so code and datasets both need to be added before an experiment can be run.

## Manage Packages

Menu: `Luminide > Manage Packages`

Install new packages by choosing the`Pip` or `Apt` tab and following the corresponding instructions. Packages that are currently installed are also listed here -- select `Featured` (i.e. popular data science packages) or `All`.

Note: Apt packages will require reinstallation if a different type of Compute Server is selected.
